repository includes -Line Follower bot program , connection sequence , desription of what i learnt over the week.

Report-topics covered

The topics covered during the vacation include:
Dijkstra algorithm : it is a maze solving solution which gives the optimal solution/ the shortest path to solve a maze/graph with or without direction obligations. There are certain drawbacks to the algorithm specifically that it can not deal with negative values and it requires the mapping of the whole path before giving solutions.Also learned and understood using it on python for a sample graph.(file attached)

A* :

BFS: Breadth first search is an algorithm that finds all nodes in a process such that it explores the adjacent nodes to a node and then further progresses by exploring all the nodes adjacent to the previous node. It can also be classified as a level order mapping of nodes.

DFS : Depth first search is an algorithm to explore all nodes in a process where an explored node is suspended upon location of another adjacent node till the bottommost node is reached and then backtraces the suspensions accordingly mapping the graph.

PID :learned about the concept of a PID (Proportional–Integral–Derivative) controller, which is widely used in control systems to maintain a desired output by minimizing error. It works by continuously calculating the difference (error) between a desired setpoint and the actual process value. The proportional term corrects based on present error, the integral term accounts for past accumulated error, and the derivative term predicts future error based on the rate of change. Together, these three terms help achieve stable, accurate, and responsive control of systems such as motors, temperature, or speed

PCB Designing :Learned about the layers of pcb 10 layers with 3 for wires, one layer for power one for ground and between these layers a sheet to prevent shortcircuiting. Learned about pcb desiging on easyeda and created samples (progress and completed images attached).
